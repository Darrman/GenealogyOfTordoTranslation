Because Tordo's addresses don't equal Binary's which probably don't equal vanilla's.
All offsets headered.

0x38CB3: Class name pointers
0x38D43: "Command Knight" (cavalier) name

0x39C59: Character name pointers
0x3A191: Tiltyu's name.

0x3DAE8: Army name pointers
0x3DD42: Tiltyu's Army

0x3DE12: Item name pointers
0x3DF26: Iron Sword name

0x3E4E8: Item description pointers
0x3E6D0: Vajra (Tiltyu's crit on demand sword) description

0x9a9dd: great shield desc
pointer location hasn't changed (9adff), but dumper melts at the dummy 00 pointers. better change them to 00 00 80 or something to hit something valid.

Taken from Binary but I want to figure this stuff out properly: stat screen labels.
(Not sure where these begin and where they end...)
This is the strength stat label. 
A9 00 89 85 25 A9 26 9D 85 24 A2 05 0D 22 54 93 87

Considering J2E tagged these as ASMPTR, it's probably ASM. So...
LDA #00 ;load zero to accumulator
BIT #2585 ;no idea. probably reading something wrong.
LDA #9D26 ;pointer to text
STA (dp) ;whatever the "direct page" is
LDX #050D ;coordinates
JSR #879354 ;jump to wherever this code is. probably the drawing code.
